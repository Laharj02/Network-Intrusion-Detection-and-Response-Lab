# Network Intrusion Detection and Response Lab

This repository contains a lab project designed to teach network intrusion detection and response skills. In this project, you'll set up a virtual network environment, configure an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), generate and analyze network traffic, and respond to detected intrusions.

## Project Overview

Intrusion detection is an essential part of cybersecurity, focused on identifying unauthorized access and malicious activity on a network. This project guides you through:
- Setting up an IDS using **Snort**
- Analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark**
- Simulating attacks using **Metasploit**
- Implementing defense mechanisms against detected threats

## Prerequisites

- Basic networking knowledge (IP addresses, ports, etc.)
- Familiarity with Linux and network security concepts

## Lab Setup and Tools

### Tools You'll Use:
- **VirtualBox**: To create virtual machines for the IDS, client, and attacker.
- **Ubuntu**: Installed on the virtual machines for IDS and client.
- **Kali Linux**: On the attacker VM for penetration testing.
- **Snort**: Open-source IDS for monitoring network traffic.
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer for detailed traffic inspection.
- **Metasploit**: Framework for simulating network attacks.

### Network Environment:
- Create a virtual network using VirtualBox with isolated VMs for the IDS, client, and attacker.
- Configure network interfaces and simulate attacks using penetration testing tools.

## Tasks

1. **Setting Up Snort**: Install and configure Snort on the IDS VM to monitor network traffic.
2. **Generating Traffic**: Use normal traffic tools and simulate attacks using Metasploit to trigger alerts.
3. **Analyzing Traffic**: Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, identifying both normal and malicious activities.
4. **Responding to Intrusions**: Respond to detected intrusions by blocking malicious traffic and updating firewall rules.

By completing this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in detecting, analyzing, and responding to network intrusions.
